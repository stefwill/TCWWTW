# The Cat Who Walks Through Walls

## 1. Game Overview
- **Title:** The Cat Who Walks Through Walls
- **Genre:** Puzzle / Adventure / Side-Scroller
- **Target Platforms:** PC
- **Engine:** Godot 4
- **Art Style:** Dark surrealism with painterly textures, inspired by Inside, Limbo, and Little Nightmares

## 2. Core Concept 
You play as Schrödinger, a cat caught between two realities after a quantum experiment goes wrong. In one world, you're a domestic house cat; in the other, a monstrous being navigating the Shadowstate - a warped, decaying reflection of reality. Your task is to solve environmental puzzles, manipulate reality, and feed on shadowy remnants of human identity to regain control of your fractured existence.

## 3. Key Features
- **Reality Shifting:** Swap between the Ordinary and the Shadowstate to solve puzzles and escape threats.
- **Cat Abilities:** Use stealth, agility, and feline behaviours (scratching, meowing, knocking items) as tools.
- **Shadowstate Rules:** Warped logic and physics, looping rooms, light-based mechanics, and emotional anchors.
- **Moral Choices:** Decide whether to consume shadows for power or spare them, influencing story outcomes and world stability.

## 4. Game Mechanics
- **2.5D Side-Scrolling Movement:** Players can walk, jump, crouch, interact with objects, and climb.
- **World Shifting:** Transition between worlds at specific thin points (mirrors, water, televisions).
- **Puzzle Interaction:** Objects differ in each world. Some only exist or behave differently in the Shadowstate.
- **Feeding Mechanic:** Absorb emotions/memories of shadow creatures to unlock powers and abilities.
- **Slippage Meter:** Measures how deeply you've merged with the Shadowstate. High slippage causes involuntary shifts and more hostile entities.

## 6. Narrative Summary 
The player uncovers the story of a quantum experiment gone wrong, blending realities. As Schrödinger, you witness how memory, guilt, and emotion shape both worlds. Your choices determine if you become a devourer of humanity, a protector of balance, or something else entirely.

---
## 7. Visual Design
- **Ordinary World:** Warm, nostalgic palette with subtle distortion
- **Shadowstate:** Cool, desaturated tones, heavy use of blacks, greys, and surreal elements. Shadow creatures are tall, faceless, and twitching.
- **UI:** Minimalist, integrated into the environment (e.g., slippage gauge appears in puddles or reflections)

---
## 8. Audio Design
- **Ordinary World:** Calm ambient music, diegetic sound, human chatter
- **Shadowstate:** Reversed audio, glitchy static, ambient dread tones
- **SFX:** Organic, textural. Each cat action (scratch, purr, hiss) has weight
